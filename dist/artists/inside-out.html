						With the International response and success of the net label, Grant realized his personal longing to progress his musical ideas even further. He relocated to Brooklyn, New York, and teamed up with Camea, Tim Xavier and Tony Rohr. Grant released his first minimal techno EP with Camea titled ‘Azimuth’ in 2006, topping sales and DJ charts around the world. As a solo artist, Grant's production combines the influences of modern minimal techno and the basic fundamentals of this genre: intricate percussive programming, dark atmospherics and irresistible cavernous groove. He most recently has done remixes for underground iconic imprints like Bruno Pronsato’s Thesongsays, IO and Lazerslut, and has a new digital EP on Clink coming out with Tim Xavier in Spring 2010.

						In recent years, Grant has meticulously created a following and demand for his deep, conceptually minimal DJ sets. He rotates gigs in South America, North America and Europe, and is a New York after-hours favorite. An avid music collector, Grant is consistent and explores the new trends and sounds within this genre, and it is guaranteed he will always have the latest and greatest ideas embedded within his performances. His live and dj shows are an array of influences and keep the floor moving from start to finish. Grant Aaron, aka Insideout, has been with Clink since it’s inception in 2005.
