  description: Grant Aaron, aka Insideout, has been with Clink since it’s inception in 2005. Grant began DJing in 1997, mainly influenced by the striped down minimal sounds of Daniel Bell, Plastikman and Mike Ink. It didn't take long for those influences to move him from behind the decks to the studio. His exploration into production initially focused on ambient and experimental, then evolving into 4/4 based electronic music. In 2000, Grant co-created the multimedia net label, Lifeform Project, which involved several producers from his hometown of Atlanta, but that was just the beginning.

						With the International response and success of the net label, Grant realized his personal longing to progress his musical ideas even further. He relocated to Brooklyn, New York, and teamed up with Camea, Tim Xavier and Tony Rohr. Grant released his first minimal techno EP with Camea titled ‘Azimuth’ in 2006, topping sales and DJ charts around the world. As a solo artist, Grant's production combines the influences of modern minimal techno and the basic fundamentals of this genre: intricate percussive programming, dark atmospherics and irresistible cavernous groove. He most recently has done remixes for underground iconic imprints like Bruno Pronsato’s Thesongsays, IO and Lazerslut, and has a new digital EP on Clink coming out with Tim Xavier in Spring 2010.
